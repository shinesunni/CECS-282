// Improvements are always welcome.
// There's probably mistakes but getting general knowledge of pointers, and references and address was the point.

/*
Prompt: Suppose I have the following C++ code. Use the space on the bottom of this page to write the 'sort3' function.
Be sure to include the prototype function (function signature) on the top of the page.
*/

/*Given code*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// enter the prototype (function signature) of sort3 here.

int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cout << "Enter 3 numbers and I will sort them";
    cin >> a >> b >> c >>; // example input: a = 9, b = 3, c = 5;
    sort3(a, b, c);
    cout << a << "," << b << "," << c; // example output: 9, 3, 5
    
/*My answer*/

sort3(&a&b&c)

void sort3(int&a, int&b, int&c) // important part
{
    int temp;
    if (a > b)
    {
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    }
    if (a > c)
    {
    temp = a;
    a = c;
    c = temp;
    }
    if (b > c)
    {
    temp =b;
    b = c;
    c = temp;
    }
}
